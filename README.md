Included in this respository is a spreadsheet. This spreadsheet will be what you use to track the combinations you have played.

To use the spreadsheet, get the information used for your game. Here is an example game.
Mastermind is
1) Epic Mojo

Whose scheme is
1) Subjugate with Obedience Disks

Villains are
1) Mojoverse
2) Vulture Tech

Henchmen is
1) Spider-Infected

Heroes are
1) Iron Fist
2) Blade
3) Patriot
4) Caiera
5) Moondragon

Steps to use the spreadsheet
1) Open the spreadsheet and go to the first tab "By Mastermind". 
2) Along the top row, find Epic Mojo. 
3) An optional step would be to hide all rows to the left of Epic Mojo. 
4) Row 3 starts the list of all schemes. Scroll down until you find "Subjugate with Obedience Disks". 
5) Put an X in the cell that intersects the mastermind and the scheme. 
6) Next, scroll down into the next section, which are Villains, and scroll down until you get to Mojoverse and then Vulture Tech. 
7) Put an X in both of these cells.
8) Scroll down into the next section, which are Henchmen, and scroll down until you get to Spider-Infected.
9) Put an X in this cell.
10) Scroll down into the next section, which are Heroes.
11) Scroll until you find all five heroes.
12) Put an X in each of these cells.

After doing this for the Masterminds move to the next tab in the spreadsheet, By Hero. For this, you will find all five heroes listed in the game. Repeat the steps above. Repeat this for tabs "By Villain", "By Henchmen", and "By Scheme"

Next move to the tab named "Villain x Villain". Like for the "By Villain" tab find the two villains listed. It will be easier if you comment out the lines before the first villain and between the first and second villain. Repeat if there are more than 2 villains. Next scroll down on the left until you see the first Villain (Mojoverse). The inersection of "Mojoverse" and "Mojoverse" is intentionally blocked with a black box. For the above scenario you need to fill out the Mojoverse top and Vulter Tech side cell as well as the Vulture Tech top and Mojoverse side cell with a X.

Do this for Hero x Hero. If you happen to have a scheme where multiple henchmen or masterminds are in the game, go to the Henchmenx Henchmen and Mastermind x Mastermind tabs.

If a mastermind leads a henchmen, the program will automatically bump the game up to four henchmen in order to bring in a new Henchmen not used.
